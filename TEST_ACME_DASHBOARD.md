# ACME Dashboard - Implementation Complete

## What Was Built

I've successfully implemented the ACME Dashboard top section as specified:

### 1. Database Schema (`convex/schema.ts`)
- Created `call_metrics` table with exact field names as specified:
  - `timestamp_utc` (ISO string)
  - `agent_name` (string)
  - `equipment_type` (string)
  - `outcome_tag` (enum: won_transferred, no_agreement_price, no_fit_found, ineligible, other)
  - `sentiment_tag` (enum: very_positive, positive, neutral, negative, very_negative)
  - `negotiation_rounds` (int)
  - `loadboard_rate` (int)
  - `final_rate` (int | null)

### 2. Backend Queries (`convex/call_metrics.ts`)
- `getSummary`: Returns aggregated KPIs and financial metrics
- `getAgents`: Returns list of unique agents
- `seedCallMetrics`: Seeds sample data (60 days, 5-12 calls/day)
- `clearCallMetrics`: Clears all data

### 3. Frontend Components

#### `AcmeTopFilters` (`client/src/components/dashboard/acme-top-filters.tsx`)
- Date Range selector (Today, Last 7, This Week, Last 30)
- Equipment filter (All, Dry Van, Reefer, Flatbed)
- Agent filter (All, Pablo, Katya)
- Outcome filter (All, Won, Lost, No-Fit)
- Granularity selector (Daily, Weekly)
- Share button (copies URL with filters)
- Fully accessible with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

#### `AcmeKpiRow` (`client/src/components/dashboard/acme-kpi-row.tsx`)
6 KPI cards in equal-width grid:
1. **Total Calls** - Integer count
2. **Win Rate** - Percentage with color-coded badge (green ≥35%, amber 25-35%, red <25%)
3. **Avg Rounds** - 1 decimal place
4. **% Price Disagreements** - Percentage
5. **% No Fit** - Percentage
6. **Sentiment Score** - -1.0 to +1.0 scale with emoji and arrow

#### `AcmeMoneyRow` (`client/src/components/dashboard/acme-money-row.tsx`)
3 financial cards:
1. **Avg Listed** - Dollar amount
2. **Avg Final** - Dollar amount
3. **Avg Uplift %** - Percentage with color coding (green ≤5%, amber 5-10%, red >10%)

#### Main Page (`client/src/pages/acme-dashboard.tsx`)
- Integrates all components
- Manages filter state
- Persists filters to URL query string (shareable links)
- Shows skeleton loaders while fetching
- Includes aria-live announcements for loading states
- Responsive layout (mobile: 2 KPIs per row, desktop: 6 across)

### 4. Routing
- Added route `/acme-dashboard` in `App.tsx`
- Added navigation button on home page

## Design & Accessibility

✅ **WCAG AA Compliant**:
- All form controls have labels (visible or sr-only)
- Keyboard navigation fully supported
- aria-live regions for loading states
- Proper semantic HTML
- Focus indicators on interactive elements

✅ **Visual Design**:
- Clean, dark-on-light color scheme
- Soft cards with 12px radius (`rounded-xl`)
- Subtle borders (`border-gray-200`)
- Proper whitespace and typography
- Color coding: Green #16a34a, Orange #f59e0b, Red #dc2626, Blue #2563eb

✅ **Responsive**:
- Mobile: filters stack, KPIs wrap 2 per row
- Desktop: all filters in one row, 6 KPIs across
- Proper touch targets and spacing

## How to Use

1. **Seed the database** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   # The seed script will automatically populate call_metrics
   npx convex run seed:default
   ```

2. **Navigate to the dashboard**:
   - Go to home page and click "ACME Dashboard" button
   - Or navigate directly to `/acme-dashboard`

3. **Use filters**:
   - Select date range, equipment, agent, outcome, and granularity
   - Data updates automatically
   - Click share button to copy shareable URL

4. **View metrics**:
   - Top row: 6 KPI cards with key performance indicators
   - Bottom row: 3 financial metrics cards

## Technical Notes

- All percentages stored as decimals (0-1) in database
- Currency values stored as integers (USD cents)
- Sentiment converted from 5-level tags to -1 to +1 numeric scale
- Filters persist to URL for shareable links
- Skeleton loaders shown during data fetch
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `/workspace/convex/call_metrics.ts` - Backend queries
- `/workspace/client/src/components/dashboard/acme-top-filters.tsx`
- `/workspace/client/src/components/dashboard/acme-kpi-row.tsx`
- `/workspace/client/src/components/dashboard/acme-money-row.tsx`
- `/workspace/client/src/pages/acme-dashboard.tsx`

### Modified:
- `/workspace/convex/schema.ts` - Added call_metrics table
- `/workspace/convex/seed.ts` - Added call_metrics seeding
- `/workspace/client/src/App.tsx` - Added route
- `/workspace/client/src/pages/index.tsx` - Added navigation button

## Next Steps

The top section is complete. If you need to add:
- Charts (outcome/sentiment over time)
- Map visualization
- Tables with detailed call data

Just let me know and I can extend the dashboard!
